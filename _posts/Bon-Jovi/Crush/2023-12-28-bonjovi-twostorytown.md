옛날 음원 값이 매우 싸던 시절엔 mp3 150 곡 다운로드권이 있고 그랬다. 물론, 그 당시에도 난 돈 없는 10대였기 때문에 불법 다운로드를 통해서 음원을 구하고는 했다. 설사 다운로드 권이 있다고 해도 엉뚱한 노래를 받는다고 날리기 싫어서 미리 들어볼 심산으로 받기도 했다.

그러다가 Bee Mp3 라는 사이트를 알게 되었고, 적지 않은 음원을 다운받고는 했다. Two Story Town도 이 사이트를 통해서 알게 되었는데, 아마도 고등학교 1학년 겨울방학 때였을 것이다. Bon Jovi 노래를 찾다가 제목이 눈에 띄어서 다운받게 되었다. 솔직히 처음엔 별로여서 딱히 즐겨 듣지는 않았다. 그러다가 힘겨운 고등학교 생활에 지쳐가고, 염세적이고 부정적인 생각으로 가득 할 때가 있었다.

I couldn't sleep
Took a walk down Second Avenue
Sick of dreaming dreams that never come true
One way street and I know where its leading to
There's a for sale sign on the front door of the city hall
The subway line got graffiti crawling off the wall
I could take a hit but I don't want to take the fall
That's just one side of the story
In this two story town
It's just the same old sights
And the same old sounds
I want to take my car and drive out of this two story town
It's the same old ship going 'round
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
It's a two story town
There's a girl that I sleep with
She's got ecstasy eyes
He promised her roses and American pie
I called her and my demons
And I kissed them both goodbye
Seven days of Monday morning
In a two story town
It's just the same old sights
And the same old sounds
I want to take my horse and ride him off this merry-go-round
It's the same old ship going 'round
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
It's a two story town
One shot to make a move now
The ghosts are calling me out
And me I'm just one story
In a two story town
But you're never going to find me in the lost and found
It's just the same old sights
And the same old sounds
I want to take my horse and ride him off this merry-go-round
It's the same old ship going 'round
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
It's a two story town
It's just the same old sights and the same old sounds
I want to take my horse and ride him off this merry-go-round
I won't give in and I won't back down
I'm going down, down, down, down down
I ain't going down, down, down, down, down
I'm never going down, down, down, down, down
It's a two-story town
