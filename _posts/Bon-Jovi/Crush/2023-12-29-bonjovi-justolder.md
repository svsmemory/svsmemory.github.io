## Introduction..

아마도 고등학교 2학년 때 였을 것이다. 지금도 그렇지만, 그때에 남의 MP3를 뒤지면서 플레이리스트를 염탐하는 취미가 있었다. 그때 그 친구의 MP3는 YP-U5 였는데, 거기서 이 노래를 보았다. 그때 노래 제목을 엉뚱하게 "Just Order" 로 읽었다. 그냥 시키라니.. 뭔가 거침없이 나아가는 그런 노래인가 하고 생각했다. 그 덕분에 이 노래를 찾을래야 찾을 수가 없었다.

Hey, man, it's been a while

Do you remember me?


When I hit the streets I was 17
A little wild, a little green
I've been up and down and in between
After all these years
Can you believe I'm still chasing that dream
But I ain't looking over my shoulder
I like the bed I'm sleeping in
It's just like me, it's broken in
It's not old -- just older
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans
This skin I'm in it's alright with me
It's not old -- just older
It's good to see your face
You ain't no worse for wear
Breathing that California air
When we took on the world
When we were young and brave
We got secrets that we'll take to the grave
And we're standing here shoulder to shoulder
I'm not old enough to sing the blues
But I wore the holes in the soles of these shoes
You can roll the dice 'til they call your bluff
But you can't win until you're not afraid to lose
Well, I look in the mirror
I don't hate what I see
There's a few more lines staring back at me
The nights have grown a little colder
Hey man, I gotta run
Now you take care
If you see coach T. Tell him I cut my hair
It's been all these years
Can you believe I'm still chasing dreams
But I ain't looking over my shoulder
I like the bed I'm sleeping in
It's just like me, it's broken in
It's not old -- just older
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans
This skin I'm in it's alright with me
It's not old -- just older
