기억을 되짚어 보면 대략 20살이 되어서 듣기 시작했던 것으로 기억한다. 중, 고등학생 시절 때부터 앨범 단위의 디깅을 하긴했지만, 그렇게 열심히 하지는 않았던 걸로 기억한다. 그러다 대학에 진학하면서 시간적 여유가 많이 생기면서 진지하게 앨범 탐구를 했던 것 같다. 특히, Crush 앨범은 내가 상당히 오래동안 좋아했던 노래인 It's My Life가 있었던 터라, 좀 상세히 디깅했었다. 순번도 3번 정도여서 어렵지 않게 접할 수 있었는데, 멜로디가 무난해서 Skip 버튼을 잠시 멈추고 곡을 감상했다.

It's hard for me to say the things
I want to say sometimes
There's no one here but you and me
And that broken old street light
Lock the doors
We'll leave the world outside
All I've got to give to you
Are these five words when I
Thank you for loving me
For being my eyes
When I couldn't see
For parting my lips
When I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me
Thank you for loving me
I never knew I had a dream
Until that dream was you
When I look into your eyes
The sky's a different blue
Cross my heart
I wear no disguise
If I tried, you'd make believe
That you believed my lies
Thank you for loving me
For being my eyes
When I couldn't see
For parting my lips
When I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me
You pick me up when I fall down
You ring the bell before they count me out
If I was drowning you would part the sea
And risk your own life to rescue me
Lock the doors
We'll leave the world outside
All I've got to give to you
Are these five words when I
Thank you for loving me
For being my eyes
When I couldn't see
You parted my lips
When I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me
When I couldn't fly
Oh, you gave me wings
You parted my lips
When I couldn't breathe
Thank you for loving me
Thank you for loving me
Thank you for loving me
Oh, for loving me
